This week in class, we were introduced to ESLint and IntelliJ. ESLint is the tool we are using to automatically check our code for being in compliance with coding standards. If there are no ESLint errors, then this is illustrated with a green checkmark on the right hand corner of IntelliJ. Compared to the previous IDE I used in prior classes, which was JGRASP, I do prefer IntelliJ so much better. Conforming to the coding standards of ESLint can be a bit tedious sometimes and will take a bit to getting used to (for example, like not using double quotes for strings, which is what I personally prefer over single quotes). I do appreciate how checking for errors is so much easier (F2 is now my friend) and it is satisfying receiving the green checkmark after. 

Although coding standards can be tedious sometimes, in the end, it is important especially when you are working on a larger codebase. Part of working as a developer will come with  working in a team and collaboration. Therefore, with coding standards that everyone follows, it will be easier for you when you have to read someone else's code and vice versa.
