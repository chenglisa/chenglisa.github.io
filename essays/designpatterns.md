## The dreaded question
As someone that is indecisive and does not really like to cook, the question that I disliked being asked is what I want to eat, especially by my boyfriend. For whatever reason, dinnertime is the meal that we struggled to decide on the most. Fortunately, over time, we have developed staple recipes that we just rotate now cooking every week (for those that are curious, the recipes are curry, burgers, spaghetti, and chicken & rice). This has made deciding what to eat easier because we know these recipes are something we both like and are familiar with cooking. These staple recipes are analogous to design patterns in software engineering â€“ reusable solutions to common problems that act as a guide for developers. Some common design patterns are singleton and factory. In singleton, only a single instance of a class can exists. In factory, objects are created, hiding the underlying logic. There are advantages and disadvantages for each design pattern. Overall, just like our staple recipes make cooking easier, design patterns can speed up the development process and improve code readability for developers.
