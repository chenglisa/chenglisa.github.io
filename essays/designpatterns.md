## The dreaded question
As someone that is indecisive and does not really like to cook, the question that I disliked being ask is what I want to eat, especially by my boyfriend. For whatever reason, dinnertime is the meal that we struggled to decide on the most. Fortunately, over time, we have developed staple recipes that we just rotate now cooking every week (for those that are curious, the recipes are curry, burgers, spaghetti, and chicken & rice).
