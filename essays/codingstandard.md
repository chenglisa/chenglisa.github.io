## As long as it works, right?


Coding standards are rules/guidelines for developers to follow to achieve cleaner and readable code. I did not realize how important coding standards were until I was working on a personal project. Because the code I was writing was not for school, meaning I would not get points deducted for not following coding standards, I was just "doing my own thing." I had that misconception, that as long as the code works, I am "all good." However, it was not until days later, when I looked back at my code and there were certain parts that I did not know why I wrote that/what it was for. This made me realize that coding standards are useful, as I was spending time trying to figure out my own code that I had wrote. From this experience, I do believe that coding standards are important because it increases efficiency and productivity, as well as making your code look neater. It will also make things easier in the long run if you have to go back to your code and you want to change something or add on to your project.
