## As long as it works, right?


Coding standards are rules/guidelines for developers to follow to achieve cleaner and readable code. I did not realize how important coding standards were until I was working on a personal project. Because the code I was writing was not for school, meaning I would not get points deducted for not following coding standards, I was just "doing my own thing." I had that misconception, that as long as the code works, I am "all good." However, it was not until days later, when I looked back at my code and there were certain parts that I did not know why I wrote that/what it was for. This made me realize that coding standards are useful, as I was spending time trying to figure out my own code. From this experience, I do believe that coding standards are important because it increases efficiency and productivity since it will 


## Java versus Javascript

Although Java and Javascript sounds similar, I learned that these two programming languages have key differences. Javascript, along with HTML and CSS are the three main languages to building websites. Having spent a year learning Java and declaring variable’s types, it felt a little strange to not have to do that with Javascript. I quickly learned about the more relaxed syntax rules for Javascript. Another difference is that in Javascript, arrays can contain multiple types and functions are first class. Although Javascript seems more forgiving than Java, I do not think one is necessarily “better” than the other – it depends on what you want to do with programming. 





##  Athletic software engineering

“Athletic Software Engineering” is a pedagogy developed by Dr. Philip Johnson and is what we are currently using in this class. It involves “a high intensity, time-constrained, and often stress-inducing approach to acquiring competency with software engineering skills.” Every week, we have a “WOD” (workout of the day), which we only have a limited amount of time to complete a coding problem. These weekly WODs are graded on an “all or nothing” approaching, meaning you either get a 100 for completing it or you get a 0. 

For me, I do find this style of learning to be stressful because the time limit can be daunting and distracting. However, after completing a few practice WODs, I am beginning to really like this style of learning because I feel like I am actually learning and it gives me the incentive to practice every day. I do believe that coding is a skill, and to get better at it, you need to do it consistently. I am nervous but also looking forward to developing my software engineering skills from this class, because web development is one of my interests in computer science.
